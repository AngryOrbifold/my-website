        <p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br>
            NOFRAT is an untimed, high-range cognitive test.<br>
            Items are presented in roughly increasing order of difficulty, but you may answer them in any order you choose.<br>
            Throughout the test, you have 35 attempts. Each incorrect answer costs one attempt.<br>
            The test ends when either your remaining attempts reach 0, all items have been solved or you click the "End Test" button.<br>
            Answers are not case-sensitive.<br>
            For spatial items, you will be provided with a canvas on which you must draw your answer.<br>
            All spatial answers are matrices composed of black and white cells. When drawing, you must choose the matrix dimensions and set the color of each cell.<br>
            Place your mouse cursor on the cell and right click to change the color of the cell.<br>
            You will answer each item as it appears, there is no option to submit all answers at once.
