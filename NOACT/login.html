        <p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br>
            NOACT is a timed, high-range cognitive test.<br>
            You have 360 hours to work on 50 items. A timer will display how much time remains.<br>
            Items are presented in roughly increasing order of difficulty, but you may answer them in any order you choose.<br>
            Throughout the test, you have 30 attempts. Each incorrect answer costs one attempt.<br>
            The test ends when either the timer reaches 0, your remaining attempts reach 0 or all items have been solved.<br>
            Answers are not case-sensitive, and spaces between words are optional.<br>
            Synonyms are accepted, and some items have multiple correct answers.<br>
            You will answer each item as it appears, there is no option to submit all answers at once.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong><br>
            Once you click "Start Test", the countdown begins.<br>
            Your time and attempts will continue to run even if you close your browser.<br>
            So please make sure you are properly prepared and motivated to finish before starting.
